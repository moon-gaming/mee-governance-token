https://polygonscan.com/address/0xEB7eaB87837f4Dad1bb80856db9E4506Fc441f3D

### This repository contains, preserved for posterity:
1. The source code to the MEE Governance Utility Token.
2. Legacy Purchase and Staking Contracts for MEE and IMX.
3. Basic NFT contracts for collections on IMX zkEVM

## Reasons for Archival:
1. No new code was, will, nor could be added to MEE Governance since its deployment.
2. The project diversified to zkEVM and other Blockchains, which requires more diverse tooling.
3. For version 2.0 of staking and purchaseswe're moving future contracts into new, more modular toolchains to facilitate faster audits and code reviews.
